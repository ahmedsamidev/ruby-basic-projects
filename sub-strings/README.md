# Project: Sub Strings

## About
<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;" >
A method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
</p>


## Example
```rb
  > substrings("Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going?", dictionary)
  => { "down" => 1, "go" => 1, "going" => 1, "how" => 2, "howdy" => 1, "it" => 2, "i" => 3, "own" => 1, "part" => 1, "partner" => 1, "sit" => 1 }


```

## Quick Start
    ruby ./sub-strings/script.rb
